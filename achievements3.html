                    students (2019-2020):</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">With funding from the Embassy of the Netherlands in
                    Bangladesh, this project adopted a “4P approach” to prevent violence and human rights
                    violations, increase knowledge and awareness of human rights among young female
                    students of madrasahs, given their particularly vulnerable status. In order to build their
                    capacity, 15 changemakers from universities were recruited to facilitate a knowledge
                    transfer and improve relationships between two groups of youth i.e. university students
                    and madrasah students, leading to an increase in a sense of belonging among 200
                    adolescents from madrasahs, and consequently increased confidence levels. Twenty
                    madrasah teachers also received the same training, and on additional topics like
                    gender discrimination and consent.
                    Due to the COVID 19 crisis, the workshops with the students could not be completed
                    but the contents will be shared through booklets to 1000 beneficiaries. Currently the
                    madrasahs along with Leaping Boundaries are advocating to establish a sexual
                    harassment complaint committee.

                    Madrasah Scholars in Bangladesh (2020): </h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">This project was created with support of
                    the Asia Foundation with the objective of reducing vulnerabilities that women and girls
                    faced during the COVID-19 crisis. The physical and mental health, hygiene and nutrition
                    needs of women and girls were effectively met in a crisis situation where they were
                    unable to access resources. Economic rations of rice, lentils, potato, salt, cooking oil,
                    onion, milk, sugar, soap, face masks, gloves and sanitary napkins were distributed to
                    seventy girls and their families, residing in Dhaka. Sets of colour pencils, art books and
                    diaries were also provided to help them therapeutically. Data was collected on the lives
                    and struggles of women and girls’ at a time when they became even more invisible to
                    inform future programming.

                        <p class="p-3"><i>“Students need to be more aware about what is harassment, sexual harassment, abuse, etc. They need to increase their  knowledge on these issues. Also we need to remember that our country has laws but they are not enforced properly. There is another problem with the education system- we are engulfed with different curriculum, syllabus, weekly tests all year round.
                            But there is a greater education that we should teach our students - moral education, safety issues, what is good and what is bad. Sometimes, the students are kept busy with different extracurricular activities to keep them away from mischief. These should be monitored too. 
                            Teachers, guardians and students, all will have to fulfill their responsibilities. A student is left with teachers only for 4-5 hours; rest of the time is with parents. So their role is more important here. Teachers should also be trained better.”</i> - Mohammad Jahangir Alam, Teacher, Gawsia Islamia Fazil Madrasah.
