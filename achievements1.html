                    Bangladesh, is Channel I's unique social change maker programme for promoting
                    improved health, well being and development amongst adolescents. Students from

                    promote Adolescent Girls’ Health for Safe Motherhood. Samiya Afrin, then a student of

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">This exhibition was themed around International Women’s
                    Day and its main focus was to shift perspectives of and about madrasahs. The
                    exhibition was organized by Leaping Boundaries and co-hosted by Leela: where minds
                    come to play. A total of 16 creative drawings and paintings which portrayed the
                    student’s self-perception were showcased at the exhibition. Prior to this, a half-day art
                    workshop was facilitated by artist Liza Hasan of Liza’s Brushes, where 57 girls from
                    Madinatul Ulum Women’s Kamil Madrasah were asked to illustrate how they view
                    themselves as women.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Global Dignity Day was celebrated with the support of
                    Friendship Bangladesh where every year, 6-7 girls from affiliated madrasahs got the
                    opportunity to share their Dignity Stories on stage in front of local and international
                    audiences. This day celebrates what it means to be a citizen of this world with rights
                    and respect. It defines dignity as every individual’s right to think and fend for
                    themselves; it allows people to be independent and different but also equally respected
                    and appreciated for the differences.

                    part in Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center’s Building Bridges through Leadership
                    Training Junior programme. The girls received training on improving speaking skills and

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Leaping Boundaries and Breakthrough Media launched a
                    social media campaign on Facebook with the hashtag #freeiam and introduced three
                    madrasah girls to female role models based on what they want to be when they grow
                    up. The objective was to break stereotypical notions around female madrasah students,
                    help them reconcile multiple dimensions of their identities, and introduce them to the
                    possibilities of achieving their latent dreams. The role models included women in
                    unconventional professions i.e. a scientist, a singer and a doctor. The girls spoke to
                    their role models and exchanged letters with them. These letters were then read out
                    aloud. The entire process was captured on camera

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Leaping
                    Boundaries was one of the curators of Women of the World Festival Dhaka 2019,
                    organized by British Council. Three segments were curated - Bites, Speed-mentoring
                    and Marketplace. The first product line of items, consisting of bookmarks, bags and
                    scarves, inspired from the stories of the madrasah girls was launched at this event. To
                    promote women empowerment and raise awareness, Leaping Boundaries coordinated

                <h4 class="pt-col-3 pt-sm-3 pt-md-4 pb-col-2 pb-sm-2 pb-md-2">Lessons Learned:</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">The Madrasahs acknowledge the lack of confidence in most students and their inability
                    to compete with students from other educational backgrounds. Hence participation in
                    platforms such as Global Dignity Day celebration, BYLC BBLT-, Dhaka Lit Fest,
                    #Youth4SDG6 was encouraged by the Madrasah authorities, as long as Leaping
                    Boundaries also arranged transportation to and from the venues. Access to leadership
                    programmes and bootcamps tends to be limited for madrasah students due to
                    affordability. The Slant Art exhibition was lauded by prominent personalities, directly
                    showcasing the never-before-seen creative capabilities of female madrasah students.
                    Toppled- a unique tech exhibition gained immense media attention and highlighted the
                    enthusiasm of female madrasah students for learning and implementing programming
                    skills in innovative ways. The #freeiam campaign helped the girls to identify with
                    inspirational women excelling in fields of science and culture, and acknowledge their
                    latent ambitions. The Girls for Peace programme was the first of its kind in Bangladesh,
                    allowing some of the girls to travel outside of their homes and Madrasahs in Dhaka for
                    the first time in their lives and engage in a unique cultural exchange with another
                    marginalised community. Overall, madrasah authorities and parents witnessed a visible
                    improvement in confidence amongst the girls.</p>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">The restrictions to the participation in such programmes arose when parents and
                    authorities were unsure if the girls would have to give up certain aspects of their
                    religious practices or compromise their safety in order to fit the bill. For instance, many
                    parents were reluctant to let their daughters take part in Shorno Kishoree as the
                    programme would be broadcasted on television and, according to some, the producers
                    preferred representing students without face coverings (Niqab). The Panel Discussion
                    on “Innovation in the Madrasah sector during the last 5 years” shined light on some
                    evident contradictions between the notion of female empowerment put forth by feminism
                    and that put forth by madrasahs in Bangladesh, and continued exploring ways of
                    reconciling these differences with the help of government and non-governmental
                    bodies.

                    pDespite logistical and scheduling issues, these activities successfully introduced the
                    students to opportunities and people that they would otherwise not have known
                    because their families and madrasahs lack the network, incentives and financial means
                    required to ensure their participation in such extracurricular programmes. While the girls
                    were always overwhelmingly enthusiastic for these programmes, their parents were
                    unwilling to allow their daughters to participate in these platforms because they couldn’t
                    comprehend the benefits of extracurricular activities. Both the parents and madrasah
                    authorities also needed to be motivated for supporting such activities, whether through
                    sharing of progress reports and press hits in Bangla (for ease of understanding)
                    featuring Leaping Boundaries, or having the girls regularly exhibit their creative works,
                    learnings and achievements.</p>

                <p class="mobile-pb-20"><i>“As several students in madrasahs are from impoverished backgrounds, there could have been provisions for food and rewards for incentivising them to take part in activities. Besides being a madrasah, Madinatul Ulum is primarily an orphanage. The children here will perhaps never get the chance to interact with influential people or visit extravagant buildings and locations. Even a one day event with 4-10 kids where they could experience anything they want, from meeting important personalities, to shopping or visiting amusement parks etc, could have created a ripple effect in expanding their aspirations.”</i> - Masuda Taiyeba, teacher and chief resource person at Madinatul Ulum Women’s Kamil Madrasah</p>

                    <p class="p-3"><i>“I couldn’t have been friends with students from other educational backgrounds if
                        Leaping Boundaries didn’t provide me with a fully funded scholarship to Bangladesh
                        Youth Leadership Center’s BBLT-J programme, as my family would not have been able
                        to afford it. I had no idea kids my age were so active in extracurriculars. We bonded
                        over our shared concerns about global warming, an issue I learned about more deeply
                        through a workshop organised by Leaping Boundaries.
                        Besides writing and painting, I also love volunteering. Till now I’ve volunteered with
                        Volunteer for Bangladesh, BYLC, Bangladesh Youth Volunteer and Shorno Kishoree.
                        Starting with raising awareness on menstrual hygiene in my madrasah in 2016 to
                        debunking myths surrounding autism within my community and, most recently,
                        promoting proper use of masks and sanitisers amongst pedestrians along a busy road
                        in Agargaon, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed advocating for causes I care about. If I am able to
                        help at least one out of every ten people I speak to, it is worth my efforts.
                        I now want to work against gender based violence in Bangladesh; not just physical
                        violence, but also mental torture, as it can oftentimes be more debilitating for victims.
                        For instance, the unwarranted comments men make on women’s social media posts
                        and their effects on women’s mental health. I don’t see women in other countries being
                        harassed online to such an extent as in Bangladesh.
                        This year, I have been appointed as the Bangladesh Ambassador to the European
                        Youth Symposium. Shagufe apu has been encouraging me to try for the United World
                        Colleges, and honestly, I don’t feel even the slightest bit nervous when I think about
                        applying abroad. My journey with Leaping Boundaries has opened my eyes to
                        innumerous opportunities for me and my family. Previously I thought I could be happy
                        with being a primary school teacher, but now I dream of teaching as a Professor at the
                        University of Dhaka.” </i></p>
