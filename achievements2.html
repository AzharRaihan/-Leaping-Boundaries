                    orientation, Leaping Boundaries Trainers facilitated English lessons during regular class
                    hours at the madrasahs. The trainers followed the government curriculum i.e. textbooks
                    from the Bangladesh Madrasah Education Board but used creative delivery methods to
                    ensure effective learning and facilitation of the syllabus. Tools such as word games,
                    storytelling, story writing, etc. were used to engage students.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">This workshop was
                    conducted by Sohara Mehroze Shachi at Madinatul Ulum Women’s Kamil Madrasah
                    where 60 students learnt about the South Asia Hub of Climate Trackers and the basics
                    of climate change. The aim was to foster understanding, concern and drive among the
                    girls about climate change. Various signs of climate change such as drought, flood,
                    cyclone, increase of water level, etc were discussed. They were also educated on how
                    to reduce pollution and have a positive impact on climate.

                        through Technological Education (2017):</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">This was a six-month project, supported by
                    the EMK Center, for ensuring that girls in madrasahs develop logical reasoning skills
                    through technological education and are able to use those skills to develop solutions to
                    social problems, thereby dissolving existing negative stereotypes and claiming their
                    positions as active citizens and positive agents of change.
                    After conducting a thorough needs and aptitude assessment among 286 girls in three
                    underprivileged madrasahs (Madinatul Ulum Mohila Kamil Madrasah, Al Amin Islamia
                    Alim Madrasah, and Gawsia Islamia Fazil Madrasah) in Dhaka city, 90 girls, aged
                    12-14, received workshops on social issues, as well training in computer programming.
                    The workshops on Epilepsy Awareness, Autism Awareness, Road Safety and Women’s
                    Safety were conducted by Identity Inclusion, Buckets Engineer, CriticaLink and বহ্নিশিখা
                    Bonhishikha - unlearn gender, respectively. Eight university students were recruited
                    and trained under THRIVE and The Tech Academy as master computer programming trainers.

                        Development (2018):</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">This 6-month activity sought to build capacity of female
                    madrasah students to increase their confidence and resilience to violent extremist
                    ideology. A multi-pronged approach was used to develop the life skills of young female
                    students. USAID’s Obirodh: Road to Tolerance project provided a Fixed Amount Award
                    with In-Kind assistance to Shammo Foundation to identify and train 28 volunteers from
                    private/public universities who were deployed to 5 madrasahs (Madinatul Ulum
                    Women’s Kamil Madrasah, Al Amin Islamia Alim Madrasah, Gawsia Islamia Fazil
                    Madrasah, Mohius Sunnah Mohila Madrasah, and Hazratbagh Islamia Alim Madrasah)
                    in Dhaka to act as mentors and counselors for 351 female students. These female
                    students got life-skills training consisting of specific topics i.e. communications,
                    leadership, and critical thinking. The female students were further organized into peerlearning groups via peer led clubs to enable transfer of skills to other students of the
                    institution. Thus, the students became self-reliant and equipped with a transferable set
                    of skills that helped to develop the students’ confidence and ultimately their resilience to
                    violent extremist ideology. During the project, there were two roundtable discussions
                    where the findings and the module developed were shared with Bangladesh Madrasah
                    Education Board and Bangladesh Teachers Training Institute. Some journalists were
                    also present but no press release happened due to the restrictive nature of the project.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">On the occasion of International Women’s Day
                    2019, experts from the field of arts and poetry conducted workshops in Gawsia Islamia
                    Madrasah with around 40 female students. Dibarah Mahboob facilitated the art
                    workshop while Nandita Adhikary facilitated the poetry workshop. They were asked
                    about their hopes and dreams and the girls produced some outstanding poems and
                    artworks.

                <h4 class="pt-col-3 pt-sm-3 pt-md-4 pb-col-2 pb-sm-2 pb-md-2">Lessons Learned:</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">English Language Development Activities received the most support from madrasahs
                    as the students from this background are commonly known for lagging behind in English
                    communication skills. This component served as the gateway for building relationships
                    with the partner institutes. Besides this, activities themed on personal and menstrual
                    hygiene were especially appealing to madrasah authorities as they coincided with
                    Islamic values focusing on cleanliness. Workshops on soft-skills, critical thinking,
                    climate change and first-aid were all novel and much needed initiatives in madrasahs.
                    The Art and poetry workshops introduced the girls to media of creative expression that
                    are inclusive of their religious sentiments, whereas the technological education and
                    training challenged them to be innovative in a completely unfamiliar field. The madrasah
                    teachers themselves were pleasantly surprised at what the girls achieved through both
                    of these programmes.
                    Among the partner institutes, some Madrasahs were considerably more cooperative in
                    accommodating the activities of Leaping Boundaries than others. Most allowed Leaping
                    Boundaries to intervene strictly after regular class hours, whereas others, mainly
                    Madinatul Ulum Women’s Kamil Madrasah, would allow volunteers from Leaping
                    Boundaries to conduct classes and workshops within class hours. The students took to
                    the volunteers and trainers quite quickly as they were considerably more approachable
                    than traditional madrasah teachers. While volunteers and trainers received orientation
                    about modest dressing etiquette before conducting any activity within madrasah
                    premises, their authorities expressed a need for more comprehensive orientations,
                    preferably from a madrasah representative.
                    There were several issues with absenteeism in trainings of trainers and volunteer
                    retention in earlier years, but these were mitigated after providing makeup trainings and
                    monetary compensation. Delays in project implementation occurred as all projects were
                    carefully vetted by madrasah board members prior to execution, to ensure none went
                    against Islamic values. Activities also had to be coordinated keeping schedules of
                    volunteers (all full-time university students), Ramadan, Eid vacations and exams of
                    madrasah students in consideration. Despite the numerous obstacles, all the students,
                    parents and madrasah teachers wanted more of such programmes to be carried out
                    regularly.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20"><i>“Islam is not just about memorising Surahs or performing Namaz, it is a comprehensive
                    guideline for leading a proper lifestyle. There is immense scope for promoting Islamic
                    teachings on cleanliness and personal hygiene through awareness campaigns. It is true
                    that the curriculum mandated to us by the Bangladesh Madrasah Education Board is
                    not sufficiently equipped to address social issues such as extremism. In order to truly
                    expand the scope of work done in madrasas regarding such issues, the civil society and
                    the Bangladesh Madrasah Education Board need to work together. Combined and
                    consolidated effort is required by both sectors to build up skills of Madrasah students,
                    male and female, to remove doubt and prejudice about their capabilities.”</i> - Abu Noman
                    Md. Mahbubur Rahman, Vice Principal, Gausia Islamia Fazil Madrasah

                    <p class="p-3"><i>We never had outsiders take our classes before, so I was very curious going into our
                        first English lesson with one of the trainers from Leaping Boundaries. She was very
                        patient and explained the lessons really well. With each passing lesson, I could
                        gradually grasp everything that was being taught.
                        I had the most fun learning how to program games. Prior to this, I had no idea how to
                        draw a car on a computer, let alone make one that could also move. I don’t think I have
                        ever felt as afraid as I did when we were told that we would have to present the games
                        in front of an audience. It was my first time getting on a stage. I was awfully nervous and
                        kept forgetting the lines of code. But everything worked out fine in the end. I wish we
                        could continue practising programming because I have forgotten everything I learned.
                        I might not be great at certain things, like painting or poetry, as many of my friends
                        turned out to be to my surprise, I am confident about my skills with administering first
                        aid. Before our workshop with Leaping Boundaries, we believed a little dab of
                        toothpaste could heal everything, from cuts to burns. For some reason we were sure it
                        could help with clotting and curing things faster. But now we know better and bring out
                        our First Aid kits when someone is hurt.
                        I hated missing out on a trip to Rangamati, as my madrasah didn’t permit me to go. The
                        same thing happened after I joined the BYLC BBLT-J programme. I, along with two
                        other girls, was forced to quit after two weeks because the classes there would stretch
                        till the evening and we wouldn’t have been able to return to the madrasah in time for the
                        Maghrib prayers. Even though I had my mother’s full support, I had to turn down those
                        opportunities. Some of the fondest memories I have are with my friends during those
                        two weeks- us travelling to BYLC together and sitting in the corner of a class where we
                        couldn’t understand a word of English that some kids were conversing in, but feeling
                        enthralled nonetheless.”</i>
