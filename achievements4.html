                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Stress management, anger management, and adolescent related mental health issues were handled
                    through psychosocial support. Symptoms of victims of abuse were identified and referred to
                    specialists as necessary. To begin with, the students were counselled in groups of four. As special
                    cases were identified, one on one counselling were provided on a need basis. The Trainers were
                    trained in providing psychosocial support by an expert in Educational Counselling Psychology.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Volunteers from the Psychosocial Support component talked to the girls at Madinatul Ulum about

                </h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Volunteers from the Psychosocial Counselling Component raised awareness on depression, stress
                    management and mental hygiene through workshops in madrasahs with both students and
                    teachers. They engaged the students in role-play exercises for them to grasp the concept of
                    depression and exchanged stories afterwards. The partner madrasahs were grossly understaffed;
                    their teachers poorly were compensated and possessed a high level of occupational stress.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">Leaping Boundaries ran workshops in five madrasahs across Dhaka city. 16-19 year old girls were
                    taught about taming their inner shadows by defining boundaries, gender, power and body
                    language, handling stress, depression and anger, managing multiple dimensions of identities and
                    leading peacefully. The girls then painted their shadows, their hopes, their conceptualization of
                    gender, religion, and identity on paper.

                <h4 class="pt-col-3 pt-sm-3 pt-md-4 pb-col-2 pb-sm-2 pb-md-2">World Mental Health Month (2019):</h4>
                <p class="mobile-pb-20">To mark World Mental Health Month, Leaping
                    Boundaries, in collaboration with Mongoldip Foundation, conducted a series of
                    awareness sessions in different institutions of Dhaka. The first session was conducted
                    in Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujib Academy by one of the Leaping Boundaries
                    Changemakers, Risalat Binte Awlad. The second session was conducted by another
                    Changemaker, Faheema Khanam in Moghbazar Girls High School. Niger Sultana
                    supported the programme as an expert consultant.

                <p class="mobile-pb-20">As part of this project, 70 girls were
                    provided with para-counseling sessions over telephone every week for three months to
                    help them unload stress and learn better coping skills. They were also provided with
                    psychoeducation on adolescence, domestic violence and related helplines. The
                    parents/guardians also received information sessions focusing on conflict and anger
                    management and how to foster better family bonding. Additional activities included
                    distribution of pamphlets on domestic violence and child abuse as awareness raising
                    material to the families of the project beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries
                    reached during this project was 324, including the household members of the 70
                    madrasah girls. A series of posts on similar pamphlet contents were also published on
                    the Leaping Boundaries social media pages. These had a total reach of 216,400.

                    deeply. This calms me down everytime I feel sad or angry.‚Äù</i>- Afroza Akhter, 17, Madinatul Ulum Women's Kamil Madrasah
                    </h4>
                <div class="highlight-impact p-sm-3 p-md-4">
                    <p class="p-3"><i>I would get really excited for the visits from the trainers. They were like our friends. We
                        were never as open with our usual teachers at the Madrasah. I had no prior experience
                        with psychosocial counseling before meeting one of the Psychosocial support
                        volunteers when I was in Grade 7. At first we all shared our personal thoughts
                        anonymously and then when I spoke to her directly, it was as if she understood my
                        deepest thoughts, without ever having met me before. I wasn't aware of it back then but
                        now I understand that I had some deep seated anger issues. We did meditation and
                        breathing exercises together. I still practice these, actively reminding myself to pause
                        and breathe whenever I come across triggers and regrets.
                        I become very angry every time someone catcalls me in the street. Once as I was
                        talking to a friend beside an alley, a couple of boys who had been ogling at us started
                        singing loudly. One of them said to the other, ‚ÄúMaybe we should stop singing, they are
                        clearly not interested.‚Äù What the boy told in response still brings my blood to boil- ‚ÄúOr
                        maybe they ARE interested and that‚Äôs why they aren‚Äôt telling us to stop.‚Äù I remember
                        going up to them and shouting my head off, only then they backed off. My mother is
                        terribly afraid of my temper, worried that it could land me in trouble some day. Even now
                        when I recall such incidents, I take the time to pause and breathe deeply. This calms
                        me down everytime I feel sad or angry.
                        My parents are very conservative, but they have both been quietly supportive of my
                        education and hobbies. However, because I couldn‚Äôt resume education during the
                        pandemic, my father had made the decision to marry me off and started exploring
                        suitors. I became very upset and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I told my friends about this and
                        together we hatched an elaborate plan to thwart any suitor from pursuing talks of
                        marriage with my parents. And let‚Äôs just say that it worked. Afterwards, not without
                        considerable deliberation with my father, I was able to persuade him to continue to
                        support my education.</i> </p>
